// this is a fork of the original purchase api script by @pythonplugin, with some minor changes done by myself. i made this for my own personal use, but decided to publish it as i thought others may find it useful too.

list of changes:
- corrected button colour to be the same as the normal buy button (was previously slightly off)
- changed font to source sans pro (personal preference)
- changed button text from "api buy" to "quick buy" (to make it more obvious what the button actually does to anyone who may not know)
- accomodated button positioning for limited time items (detects if item is limited time and slightly lowers button to avoid overlapping with the countdown)
