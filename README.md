**what does it do?**  
it is essentially a quicker buy button. 
it skips the purchase confirmation message, as well as fixing bugs such as the site saying you don't have enough robux or tix even though you do.

**additional note:**
please keep in mind the quick buy button will NOT work for clothes made by groups. i've tried to fix this, but could not figure out how. clothing made by individual users, however, can still be bought without issues.
